# Notebooks

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks used to perform the numerical
calculations and generate figures for the accompanying manuscript:

*Momentum-space gravity from the quantum geometry and entropy of Bloch electrons*  
Phys. Rev. Research **4**, 013217 (2022)

Each notebook focuses on a specific stage of the analysis and can be run
independently, though they are logically ordered as described below.

## Notebook Overview

1. **Model TBG Hamiltonian**  
   Constructs the continuum model Hamiltonian for twisted bilayer graphene,
   including the moiré potential and symmetry constraints used throughout the
   paper.

2. **Band Structure Calculation**  
   Computes the Bloch band structure of the model Hamiltonian along high-symmetry
   paths in the moiré Brillouin zone and reproduces the band dispersions shown in
   the manuscript.

3. **Quantum Geometric Tensor Calculations**  
   Evaluates quantum geometric quantities of the Bloch bands, including the
   Berry curvature and quantum metric, which form the basis for the geometric
   and entropic responses discussed in the paper.

4. **Geodesic Response Calculations**  
   Computes the momentum-space geodesic response derived from the quantum
   geometry, illustrating the emergence of momentum-space gravitational effects.

## Usage Notes

- The notebooks are written for clarity and reproducibility rather than
  computational efficiency.
- Parameters used in the manuscript are indicated explicitly within each
  notebook.

## Requirements

The notebooks require a standard scientific Python environment (NumPy,
Matplotlib) and Jupyter.
