**Title:**  
Momentum-space gravity from the quantum geometry and entropy of Bloch electrons

**Journal Reference:**  
Physical Review Research **4**, 013217 (2022)  
DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevResearch.4.013217

**Description:**  
The numerical scripts and Jupyter notebooks provided in this repository
reproduce the theoretical calculations and figures presented in the manuscript.
These include computations of Bloch band structures, quantum geometric
quantities (Berry curvature and quantum metric), and momentum-space gravitational
responses discussed in the paper.

The notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory implement the models and analysis
used in the manuscript and can be executed to reproduce the key numerical
results and figures.
